# QRB Color Space Conversion ROS Node

## Overview

Qualcomm's smart devices, such as the RB3 Gen2, use NV12 as the default image color space conversion format. Generally, the more common color space format is RGB888. To embrace open source and facilitate developers in converting between these two formats, we have developed the color space conversion ROS node. The feature as follows:

- Provide ROS node include
  - API to convert nv12 to rgb8
  - API to convert rgb8 to nv12
- Support dmabuf fd as input / output
- Input / output image receive/send with QRB ROS transport
- Hardware accelerates with GPU by OpenGL ES
